# Ultimate_Tic_Tac_Toe
This project is an implementation of the classic game Ultimate Tic Tac Toe coded in Python.

## Overview

In this version, each cell of the Tic Tac Toe grid is another independent game of Tic Tac Toe. Winning a smaller Tic Tac Toe game grants you control of the corresponding cell in the larger grid.

## Features
